## Introduction

My name is **Jiahui Tang**, and I go by ~~Jerry~~ Jarry. I am a new master of Engineering student in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I did my undergraduate study in Sichuan University(*Chengdu, China*), majoring in Information Security. Recently I am interested in areas of Software Engineering and Computer Systems.

I hope I can learn some data analysis skills and the use of R programming Language by taking [STAT 545 & 547M](http://stat545.com).

## Report My Process

***Did you edit in the browser at github.com?***

I created a new repository for Homework01, and added description and website to this repo. Then I opened `README.md` and edited the files in the browser. I can directly `PULL` my new changes with commits by using Github, and also can `Clone or Download` the URL of this repo. It is easy to practice and suited to add simple words.

***Did you pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com?***

I pulled my repository to local and edit `README.md` with two different ways.
1. Edit by Mac Commandline(*Bash*). I looked up [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) and echo some simple words to `README.md` with commits, then pushed to GitHub.com.
2. Edit by RStudio. I learned from [@jrebane's sample Readme](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/hw01_sample_readme.md) and its [raw source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/master/hw01_sample_readme.md). I used some aspects of the Markdown syntax, like links, gif embed, bold and header, etc. For the `gapminder`, I used RStudio a lot.

***How did it all work for the R Markdown document?***

Everything worked well finally after doing small fixes and tweaks. I have encoutered with some problems like failing to add commits by RStudio,and I just tried again and it worked. Also there were some warnings when Knitting Files.

## Summary

I think Github is very useful for IT workers, and we can find so many open source Projects and also can manage our code remotely. R Markdown has its own syntax, it would be helpful to edit some supporting files and generate PDF files, HTML files.
