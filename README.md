Hi, Everyone! Welcome to this repo and feel free to look~

## INTRODUCTION

My name is **Jiahui Tang**, and I go by ~~Jerry~~ Jarry. I am a new master of Engineering student in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I did my undergraduate study in Sichuan University(*Chengdu, China*), majoring in Information Security. Recently I am interested in areas of Software Engineering and Computer systems.

I hope I can learn some data analysis skills and the use of R programming Language by taking [STAT 545 & 547M](http://stat545.com).
