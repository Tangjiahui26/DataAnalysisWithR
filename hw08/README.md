### [Homework 08: Building Shiny apps](http://stat545.com/hw08_shiny.html)

***Build a new Shiny app***

The app we developed is functional, but there are plenty of improvements that can be made. You can compare the app we developed to Deanâ€™s version of this app to get an idea of what a more functional app could include. For the homework, you need to either develop a new Shiny app, using your preferred dataset (or one you want to know more about). If you are short on ideas, you can instead add 3 or more features to the BC Liquor Store app we developed together.

 checkboxInput("checkInput","Filter by country",value = FALSE),
               #  conditionalPanel(
               #      condition = "input.checkInput == 'TRUE'",
                     uiOutput("countryOutput"))
                 )),
