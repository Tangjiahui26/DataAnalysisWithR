Hi, Everyone! Welcome to this repo for Homework08.:smirk:

### [Homework 08: Building Shiny apps](http://stat545.com/hw08_shiny.html)

***Build a new Shiny app***

The app we developed is functional, but there are plenty of improvements that can be made. You can compare the app we developed to Deanâ€™s version of this app to get an idea of what a more functional app could include. For the homework, you need to either develop a new Shiny app, using your preferred dataset (or one you want to know more about). If you are short on ideas, you can instead add 3 or more features to the BC Liquor Store app we developed together.

## Report My Process

*In this part, I decided to improve the BC Liquor websit that we have developed in class.*

*The final Shiny app is deployed online on`Shinyapps.io`, and the link is [here: My Liquor Store Webpage](https://tangjiahui26.shinyapps.io/hw08/)*

### Features I Added to My App

+ Add an option to sort the results by`country` using`checkboxInput()` to get TRUE/FALSE values from use. :white_check_mark:

+ Add an image of the Liquor Store to the UI.:white_check_mark:
    
    - I embeded the picture into the sidebarPanel
    - The picture was downloaded from Internet and stored at`./WWW` document

+ Use the`DT` package to return the current results table into an interactive table. :white_check_mark:

+ Solve the warning message when the user selects filters that return 0 results. :white_check_mark:

    - Inside the filtered reactive function, we should check if the input exists, and if not then just return NULL.  
    - *I have finished this part in advance, but actually I changed the`if else` statement with new logic to get multiple results later*.
    
+ Place the plot and the table in separate tabs. :white_check_mark:

+ Add a CSS file under WWW and make your app look nicer. :white_check_mark:

    - `shinyjs` was used to help load CSS and JaveScript. I wrote a simple CSS include adding background, setting the font-size and characters' color. An Alterbox will appear to introduce the main function of the website by using JS.
    
+ Experiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny, such as`shinyjs, leaflet, shinydashboard, shinythemes, ggvis`. :white_check_mark:

    - As I mentioned above, I used`shinyjs` to make my website more beautiful. In addition, I also applied`ggvis` to get more suitable plots for HTML instead of `ggplot`.
    
+ Show the number of results found whenever the filters change. :white_check_mark:

+ Allow the user to download the results. :white_check_mark:

    - In this part, plots actually can be download by the default functions of`ggvis`, so I just set one downloadbox to store the table results.
    
+ Allow the usr to search for multiple alcohol types and countries simultaneously. :white_check_mark:

    - I set a`checkbox` for user if they want to filter the results by countries. I also made the filter part multi-selection by adding some`if else` codes.
    
### Problems

*I encountered with some problems when buliding my app, most of them were solved by myself or searching online:*

1. I tried to add a checkbox to filter the results by countries. At first I was using conditinalPanel() as follows, but it did not work. Finally I just added a logical judgement statement:`if(input$checkInput)` to deal with it.

```R
 checkboxInput("checkInput","Filter by country",value = FALSE),
               #  conditionalPanel(
               #      condition = "input.checkInput == 'TRUE'",
                     uiOutput("countryOutput"))
                 )),
```

2. When using`ggvis` to make plots, I met with error with codes below. 

```R
    output$Mist_AlcCont <- renderPlot({
        if(is.null(Filtered_bcl())){
            return()
        }
        Filtered_bcl() %>% 
            ggvis(~Alcohol_Content, fill := "#fff8dc") %>% 
            layer_histograms(width = 2, center = 0)
    })
```

I found some questions similar on stackoverflow, and changed my codes as follow. `plotOutput()` also changed into `ggvisOutput`

```R
reactive({
        Filtered_bcl() %>% 
            ggvis(~Alcohol_Content, fill := "#f5edc9") %>% 
            layer_histograms(width = 1, center = 0)
   }) %>% bind_shiny("Mist_AlcCont")
```

3. I met with a silly error which took me a long time to solve. When choosing multiple countries or types, the number of results decreased instead of being larger. Then I found that I should change`==` into `%in%`, I think I still not so familiar with ShinyApp, especially the functions and its parameters and outputs.

```R    
    Type %in% input$typeInput
```

4. I found a problem with DT table: I cannot shrink the dtdatatable by changing value of `width`, and the table won't be shrinked when resizing the browser window. I added CSS script to change the font size later to make it looks better, but the problem still exists.
```R
    #before
    DT::dataTableOutput("table",width = "100%", height = "auto"))
    #later
    div(DT::dataTableOutput("table"), style = "font-size: 75%; width: 75%")
```
