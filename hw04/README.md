***General data reshaping and relationship to aggregation***

- Problem: You have data in one “shape” but you wish it were in another. Usually this is because the alternative shape is superior for presenting a table, making a figure, or doing aggregation and statistical analysis.

- Solution: Reshape your data. For simple reshaping, gather() and spread() from tidyr will suffice. Do the thing that it possible / easier now that your data has a new shape.

***Join, merge, look up***

- Problem: You have two data sources and you need info from both in one new data object.

- Solution: Perform a join, which borrows terminology from the database world, specifically SQL.
