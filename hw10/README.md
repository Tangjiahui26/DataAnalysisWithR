### [Homework 10: Data from the Web](http://stat545.com/hw10_data-from-web.html)

***Big picture***

There are three ways to get data from the internet into R:

+ Make API queries “by hand” using httr.
+ Use an R package that wraps an API, such as the many from rOpenSci.
+ Scrape the web. <- this is the one we saw in class so far
Pick (at least) one of the exercises below. At least one prompt is given for each of the above approaches.

***Make API queries “by hand” using`httr`***

Create a dataset with multiple records by requesting data from an API using the httr package.

***Use an R package that wraps an API***

Many APIs have purpose-built R packages that make it even easier to get data from them.

If you choose one of these options, then you need to go further and combine two datasets, at least one of which is from the web.
