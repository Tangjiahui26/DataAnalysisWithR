Hi, Everyone! Welcome to this repo for Homework10.:smirk:

### [Homework 10: Data from the Web](http://stat545.com/hw10_data-from-web.html)

***Big picture***

There are three ways to get data from the internet into R:

+ Make API queries “by hand” using httr.
+ Use an R package that wraps an API, such as the many from rOpenSci.
+ Scrape the web. <- this is the one we saw in class so far
Pick (at least) one of the exercises below. At least one prompt is given for each of the above approaches.

***Make API queries “by hand” using`httr`***:white_check_mark:

Create a dataset with multiple records by requesting data from an API using the httr package.

GET() data from the API and convert it into a clean and tidy data frame. Store that as a file ready for (hypothetical!) downstream analysis. Do just enough basic exploration of the resulting data, possibly including some plots, that you and a reader are convinced you’ve successfully downloaded and cleaned it.

***Scrape data***:white_check_mark:

Work through the final set of slides from the rOpenSci UseR! 2016 workshop. This will give you basic orientation, skills, and pointers on the rvest package.

Scrape a multi-record dataset off the web! Convert it into a clean and tidy data frame. Store that as a file ready for (hypothetical!) downstream analysis. Do just enough basic exploration of the resulting data, possibly including some plots, that you and a reader are convinced you’ve successfully downloaded and cleaned it.
