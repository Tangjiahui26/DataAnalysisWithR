Hi, Everyone! Welcome to this repo for Homework02.:smirk:

## Homework02 Materials

### [Homework02](https://stat545.com/hw02_explore-gapminder-dplyr.html)

- Make a homework repo
- Bring rectangular data in
- Smell test the data
- Explore individual variables
- Explore various plot types
- Use filter(), select() and %>%
- Some “above and beyond”

## Report My Process

1. When I tried to make a new homework repo, actually I did not kown how to create a new folder and how to move all the hw01 files into the hw01 folder, so I searched on the Internet and finnally used [`sourcetree'](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) to make it
work locally(I think it also could be realized by using RStudio), then I pushed those documents into Github.

2. Acutally I am kind of confused with `typeof()`, `mode()` and `class()`. There is a clear explanation on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8855589/a-comprehensive-survey-of-the-types-of-things-in-r-mode-and-class-and-type). I believe `mode()` would get the type or storage mode of an object,while `typeof()` function would be more specific. The `class()` is used to define/identify what "type" an object is from the point of view of object-oriented programming in R.

3. I think homework02 is not so tough, but honestly speaking, I spent a lot of time doing it. Hope I can become more skilled with R programming by more practise.
